# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to my version of Tic-Tac-Toe!  Enjoy playing this favorite from my childhood which uses logic and strategy to win against an opponent! 

This game was built from scratch, and helped to solidify the follow concepts:
- creating DRY JavaScript
- utilizing localStorage to persist data
- using event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- keeping the data model and DOM manipulation updated, but separate
- iterating through DOM elements with for loops
- employing problem solving process to break down large problems, solving things step by step, and trusting myself to work through the logic!

## Game Rules

The game will default to Player 1 going first,
